### Typography

I used Google Fonts to import the following fonts to use in my game site. 

* [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=noto+serif&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for Game heading and Questions.
* [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=open+sans&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for all other texts in game.
Noto Serif is a serifed typeface created by Google specially for users to consume written digital content. So, naturally it is legible on the screen despite its decorate swashes.
I first got the heading font i wanted from Google fonts and i used [typ.io](https://typ.io/fonts/noto_serif) to get a font that it pairs well with .
### Imagery

Since this quiz game is about programming , i wanted to use a background image that would allow the user to experience being in th "coding" world.
I got the image from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) website but have also mentioned this in [Credits](#credits).

### Wireframes

I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for mobile, tablet and desktops screens.

### Features

### Accessibility

I ensured to provide sufficient accessibility throughout the making of this game site by the following ways:

* I used semantic HTML.
* Ensures that there is sufficient colour contrast throughout the game site.
* Ensured that user knows when their answer is correct or wrong by using red and green shade to highlight answer.
* Ensure that the user can see the score while playing (this would also help users that maybe color blind).
* Allowed users to see their score in scoreboard to compare.
